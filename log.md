# üìù VibeParse Project Log

### 2024-12-19: #28 - Mock Mode Banner Implementation and Config Endpoint
- **Added config endpoint** (`src/api/routes/test.py`):
  - **New `/api/config` endpoint**: Returns application configuration including mock mode status
  - **Real-time detection**: Frontend can now detect when MOCK_LLM_MODE is enabled
  - **Environment information**: Also returns current environment (development/production)
  - **Proper logging**: Logs config requests for debugging
- **Implemented mock mode banner** (`src/frontend/src/components/IndexPage.tsx`):
  - **Visual indicator**: Yellow banner appears when mock mode is active
  - **Clear messaging**: Shows "Mock Mode Active - Using test data instead of real API calls"
  - **Emoji icons**: Theatre masks (üé≠) for visual appeal
  - **Auto-detection**: Checks config endpoint on component mount
  - **Conditional placeholder**: Changes input placeholder text in mock mode
  - **Optional URL**: GitHub URL becomes optional when mock mode is enabled
- **Enhanced user experience**:
  - **Loading state**: Handles config loading gracefully
  - **Error handling**: Falls back to non-mock mode if config fails
  - **Visual feedback**: Users immediately know when in mock mode
  - **Helpful messaging**: Placeholder text explains mock mode behavior
- **Backend improvements**:
  - **Restored test endpoint**: Added back the original test-llm-simple endpoint
  - **Better organization**: Clear separation between config and test endpoints
  - **Consistent responses**: All endpoints follow same mock mode pattern
- **Usage**: Set `MOCK_LLM_MODE=true` environment variable and restart backend to see banner
- **Status**: Mock mode detection working correctly (placeholder text changes, API calls succeed), banner display has minor rendering issue but core functionality operational
- **Result**: Users can use mock mode functionality even though visual banner indicator needs debugging

### 2024-12-19: Mock LLM Mode Implementation for Development Cost Reduction
- **Added Mock LLM Mode** to `src/services/script_generator.py`:
  - **Environment variable control**: `MOCK_LLM_MODE=true` enables mock mode
  - **Skip LLM calls**: When enabled, uses existing `test_output/src_script.md` instead of making API calls
  - **Cost reduction**: Perfect for development and testing without incurring OpenAI API costs
  - **Same interface**: Mock mode maintains the same API and return format as real LLM calls
- **Enhanced test endpoint** (`src/api/routes/test.py`):

  - Returns mock response when `MOCK_LLM_MODE=true` is set
  - Maintains consistent behavior across all LLM endpoints
- **Created test script** (`simple_mock_test.py`):
  - Demonstrates how to use mock mode
  - Validates that `src_script.md` exists and can be parsed
  - Shows scene count and titles from the mock data
  - Provides clear usage instructions and development tips
- **Frontend improvements** (`src/frontend/src/components/IndexPage.tsx`):
  - **Auto-detect mock mode**: Frontend automatically detects when mock mode is enabled
  - **Optional URL field**: GitHub URL becomes optional when mock mode is active
  - **Visual indicators**: Clear yellow banner shows when mock mode is active
  - **Better UX**: Loading spinner while checking configuration, helpful placeholders
  - **Smart validation**: URL required only in real mode, optional in mock mode
- **Backend improvements** (`src/services/script_generator.py`):
  - **Handle empty URLs**: Gracefully handles empty or default URLs in mock mode
  - **Better logging**: Enhanced logging for mock mode operations
  - **Default repository name**: Uses 'mock-repository' for empty URLs
- **Usage instructions**:
  ```bash
  # Enable mock mode for development
  export MOCK_LLM_MODE=true
  python simple_mock_test.py
  
  # Or run directly with mock mode
  MOCK_LLM_MODE=true python simple_mock_test.py
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Zero API costs during development
  - Fast response times (no network calls)
  - Consistent test data for UI development

  - 2-second delays between batches to avoid rate limits
  - Proper error handling for batch processing with skipped files tracking
- **Testing ready**: The implementation follows the exact patterns specified in `instructions_add_llm_throttling.md` and is ready for testing with large repositories to verify 429 error handling and throttling behavior.

### June 2024: Product Pivot to Code + Explanations (No Video)
- Pivoted product direction: now outputs code snippets and bite-sized explanations for a frontend, not video content.
- Updated `prd.md`, `development-plan.md`, and `readme.md` to reflect the new focus on code + explanations and removed video/TTS-specific sections.
- Strengthened LLM prompt to require every code entity mention to be wrapped in Markdown backticks and clarified explanation requirements for clarity and consistency. **(Later reverted: explicit code entity formatting instruction was removed, now using default LLM behavior.)**

### June 2024: Video generation working but sometimes rendered code is too small
- [2024-06-XX] Video generation pipeline is functional and produces scene-based videos from Markdown scripts.
- However, rendered code is sometimes too small for optimal viewing; further improvements to dynamic font sizing or layout may be needed.

### June 2024 (Video Generation): CodeHighlight Attribute Update
- [2024-06-XX] Updated video generation to use correct CodeHighlight attributes:
  - Changed from `explanation` to `description` to match the model
  - Updated all variable names and file paths to reflect this change
  - Ensures proper handling of code highlight descriptions

### June 2024 (Video Generation): MoviePy 2.2.1 Audio Method Update
- [2024-06-XX] Updated MoviePy audio handling to match 2.2.1 API:
  - Changed from `set_audio()` to `with_audio()` method
  - Updated all clip audio assignments to use the new method
  - Ensures proper audio synchronization in multi-segment videos

  - Changed from direct `resize()` method to using `Resize` effect class
  - Using `with_effects([Resize(new_size=size)])` for resizing clips
  - Ensures proper video dimensions for TikTok/Reels format (1080x1920)

### June 2024 (Video Generation): MoviePy 2.2.1 Duration Method Update
- [2024-06-XX] Updated MoviePy duration setting to match 2.2.1 API:
  - Changed from `set_duration()` to `with_duration()` method
  - Updated all clip duration settings to use the new method
  - Ensures proper timing for multi-segment videos

### June 2024 (Video Generation): MoviePy 2.2.1 Import Updates
- [2024-06-XX] Updated MoviePy imports to match 2.2.1 API:
  - Changed from `moviepy.editor` to direct imports from `moviepy`
  - Updated imports for `AudioFileClip`, `ImageClip`, `CompositeVideoClip`, and `concatenate_videoclips`
  - Ensures compatibility with latest MoviePy version

### June 2024 (Video Generation): Multi-Segment Video Generation
- [2024-06-XX] Enhanced video generation to support full scene content:
  - Now generates separate video segments for scene introduction and each code highlight
  - Each segment includes both explanation and code with synchronized audio
  - Uses temporary directory for intermediate files during generation
  - Concatenates all segments into a single video while maintaining proper timing
  - Maintains TikTok/Reels format (1080x1920) throughout

### June 2024 (Video Generation): MoviePy 2.2.1 API Update
- [2024-06-XX] Updated video composer to use MoviePy 2.2.1 API:

  - Using `clip.with_effects([Resize(new_size=size)])` for resizing
  - Maintains compatibility with TikTok/Reels format (1080x1920)

### June 2024 (Batching Milestone): Multi-File Script Generation with Batching
- [2024-06-XX] Added support for generating scripts from multiple files in a codebase using per-file batching to stay within LLM token limits.
- Each file is token-estimated and grouped into batches; batches are processed sequentially and results are aggregated into a single Markdown script.
- Large files that exceed the token threshold are skipped gracefully and listed in the output.
- Added real-time logging for GitHub fetching, batching, and script generation progress.
- Successfully tested on the full snap-read codebase: multi-file, multi-batch script generation now works end-to-end.

### June 2024: Scene-Based Script Generation with Code Blocks
- Updated LLM prompt to require actual code snippets (as fenced code blocks) for every code highlight in each scene, unless the scene is only context/transition.
- Enhanced the response parser to extract code blocks from the LLM output, and if missing, fetch the code directly from the file using line numbers.
- Updated the `CodeHighlight` model to include a `code` field and improved Markdown rendering to always show code blocks after each explanation.
- The generated Markdown scripts are now suitable for both human review and downstream video generation.
- Successfully tested end-to-end: can now generate scene-based explanations with code for a single file (e.g., `App.tsx` from snap-read).

  - Ready for integration with backend API

### June 2024: Fix Redundant Scene Title Prefix
- Updated `src/services/script_generator.py` to only prepend `Scene X:` to scene titles if not already present.
- Prevents double prefixes like `Scene 2: Scene 2: Anchoring the App` in generated markdown and UI.

## Phase 2: Code Analysis & Script Generation (June 2024)

### 1. LLM Service & OpenAI Integration
- Added `src/services/llm_service.py` for GPT-4o integration using environment variable loading (`OPENAI_API_KEY` via `.env`)
- Implemented prompt structure and response parsing for code explanation scripts

### 2. Script Generation Service & Models
- Added `src/services/script_generator.py` to coordinate GitHub code fetching and LLM script generation
- Added `src/models/script.py` with `Script`, `Scene`, and `CodeHighlight` models

### 3. API Endpoints

## Summary of Progress (as of June 2024)

### 1. Project Initialization
- Created a new repository: [VibeParse](https://github.com/gkrinker/VibeParse)
- Added key planning documents:
  - [Product Requirements Document (prd.md)](prd.md)
  - [Development Plan (development-plan.md)](development-plan.md)
  - Updated [README](readme.md) to link to these documents

### 2. Backend Setup (Phase 1)
- Set up a Python FastAPI backend with the following structure:
  - `src/api/app.py`: Main FastAPI app
  - `src/api/routes/code.py`: API endpoint for code fetching
  - `src/services/github_service.py`: Service for interacting with the GitHub API
  - `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
  - `.gitignore`: Now excludes `.env` and other sensitive files
- Added a `.env` file (not tracked in git) for storing the GitHub Personal Access Token

### 3. GitHub Code Fetching
- Implemented `/api/fetch-code` endpoint:
  - Supports both single file (`/blob/branch/path`) and directory (`/tree/branch/path`) GitHub URLs
  - Handles branch names correctly when fetching content
  - Allows filtering by file type for directories
  - Added an optional `save_to_disk` flag to save fetched files locally in a `test_output/` directory, preserving structure
- Example usage:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/fetch-code \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "github_url": "https://github.com/gkrinker/snap-read/tree/main/src",
      "file_types": ["ts", "tsx", "js"],
      "save_to_disk": true
    }'
  ```

### 4. Security & Git Hygiene
- Accidentally committed `.env` (with secret) to git; push was blocked by GitHub
- Removed `.env` from git tracking and history using `git filter-repo --force`
- Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub
- Confirmed repository is now safe and up to date

### 5. Next Steps
- Phase 1 (code retrieval) is complete and tested
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Code Analysis & Script Generation

- Development environment is properly configured with correct versions

---

**This log is intended for all agents and contributors to quickly understand the current state and history of the VibeParse project.**

---
2024-06-15: Added runtime.txt to pin Python version to 3.11.9 for Render.com deployment. This avoids build errors related to Rust and ensures pre-built wheels are used for dependencies like pydantic-core and aiohttp. 

2024-06-15: Pinned pydantic to 2.5.3 and added pydantic-core 2.14.6 in requirements.txt to avoid Rust build issues on Render.com. Removed pydantic==2.6.1.

2024-06-15: Added tiktoken==0.6.0 to requirements.txt to fix ModuleNotFoundError during deployment on Render.com. 

2024-06-15: Added pygments, Pillow, and moviepy to requirements.txt to ensure all backend dependencies are included for deployment on Render.com. 

2024-06-15: Removed moviepy, Pillow, pygments, and all video-related code and routes since video generation is no longer supported in the project. 

### 2024-06-15: Final Video Code Purge and Double-Check
- Searched all Python and markdown files for any remaining references to video, scene_to_video, video_composer, moviepy, Pillow, and related classes/functions.
- Removed 'video' from FastAPI app description and reworded comments in code_render.py.
- Confirmed no video-related code, imports, or bytecode remain in the backend or documentation (except for historical log and PRD entries).
- Project is now fully focused on code explanations only.

### 2024-06-XX: Ignore test_output/ and Remove Test Artifacts from Git Tracking
- Added test_output/ to .gitignore to prevent test artifacts from being committed.
- Removed all files in test_output/ from git tracking using git rm --cached -r test_output/.
- Committed and pushed the cleanup to remote.
- This ensures test output files are ignored in future commits and keeps the repository clean.

# 17. 2024-06-XX: Frontend UI/UX Improvements and Layout Fixes
- Set the background of the entire app to white for a cleaner look.
- Ensured code block and explanation are always visually separated and on correct backgrounds.
- Removed flex-1 from scrollable area so content only grows with children.
- Cleaned up code block container spacing and scroll behavior.
- Added/updated Header component for navigation.
- Committed and pushed all changes to git.

1. Hid the UI for the File Types section in the frontend form (IndexPage.tsx) by commenting out the label and checkboxes rendering code. Left the related state and logic untouched as requested.

2. Reduced empty space above the form on the index page by removing 'h-screen' from the container div and adding 'mt-12' for a more compact, top-aligned layout. (IndexPage.tsx)

18. 2024-06-XX: Refactored Batching to Use Single Chat (Conversation History)
- Updated `src/services/script_generator.py` to maintain a single chat history (messages list) for all batch prompts and LLM responses.
- Each batch prompt and response is appended to the chat, so the LLM has full context of all previous explanations.
- If the input is a directory and the intro chapter feature is enabled, the intro chapter is now generated as the final user message in the same chat, giving it access to all prior context.
- This improves lesson cohesion, reduces redundancy, and enables better cross-file insights.
- Logging updated for clarity and debugging.

### 2024-06-20: Added Global LLM Call Semaphore for Throttling
- **Added a global `asyncio.Semaphore` (`llm_semaphore`) in `src/services/script_generator.py`** to ensure only one LLM call is in flight at a time across all batches/chapters.
- **Updated `call_llm_with_retries`** to use the semaphore, serializing all LLM calls and preventing concurrent requests that could exceed OpenAI rate limits.
- This should resolve 429 errors when processing large repos with many batches/scenes.
- No changes to business logic or API; only internal throttling improved.

#1: UI Overhaul for Index Page
- **Replaced `IndexPage.tsx`** with a new version based on `test_output/generated-page.html`.
- **New Design**: Implemented a complete UI overhaul to match the provided HTML guide, including:
  - A sticky header with logo.
  - A gradient background in the hero section.
  - A polished, centered layout.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**:
  - **Custom Dropdowns**: Replaced native `<select>` elements with custom, fully-styled dropdown components for "Proficiency" and "Scope" using React hooks.
  - **Tabbed Interface**: Implemented a functional tab system for "Explain File/Directory" and "Explain Recent Changes".
- **Component & Styling**:
  - Translated the static HTML structure into reusable JSX.
  - Integrated `lucide-react` for all icons as specified in the design.
  - Ensured all Tailwind CSS classes from the guide were applied for a pixel-perfect match.
- **Functionality**:
  - Maintained the existing form submission and API call logic, connecting it to the new UI elements.
  - Added basic error handling for the "Explain Recent Changes" tab, as it's not yet implemented.
