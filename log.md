### June 2024 (Batching Milestone): Multi-File Script Generation with Batching
- [2024-06-XX] Added support for generating scripts from multiple files in a codebase using per-file batching to stay within LLM token limits.
- Each file is token-estimated and grouped into batches; batches are processed sequentially and results are aggregated into a single Markdown script.
- Large files that exceed the token threshold are skipped gracefully and listed in the output.
- Added real-time logging for GitHub fetching, batching, and script generation progress.
- Successfully tested on the full snap-read codebase: multi-file, multi-batch script generation now works end-to-end.

### June 2024: Scene-Based Script Generation with Code Blocks
- Updated LLM prompt to require actual code snippets (as fenced code blocks) for every code highlight in each scene, unless the scene is only context/transition.
- Enhanced the response parser to extract code blocks from the LLM output, and if missing, fetch the code directly from the file using line numbers.
- Updated the `CodeHighlight` model to include a `code` field and improved Markdown rendering to always show code blocks after each explanation.
- The generated Markdown scripts are now suitable for both human review and downstream video generation.
- Successfully tested end-to-end: can now generate scene-based explanations with code for a single file (e.g., `App.tsx` from snap-read).

## Phase 2: Code Analysis & Script Generation (June 2024)

### 1. LLM Service & OpenAI Integration
- Added `src/services/llm_service.py` for GPT-4o integration using environment variable loading (`OPENAI_API_KEY` via `.env`)
- Implemented prompt structure and response parsing for code explanation scripts

### 2. Script Generation Service & Models
- Added `src/services/script_generator.py` to coordinate GitHub code fetching and LLM script generation
- Added `src/models/script.py` with `Script`, `Scene`, and `CodeHighlight` models

### 3. API Endpoints
- Added `/api/generate-script` endpoint for generating explanation scripts from GitHub URLs
- Added `/api/test-llm` endpoint for simple OpenAI connectivity testing

### 4. Environment & Security
- Added `.env` loading with `python-dotenv`
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files

### 5. Testing & Verification
- Successfully tested `/api/test-llm` endpoint with curl, confirming OpenAI connectivity and response
- Ready to proceed with full script generation flow

## Summary of Progress (as of June 2024)

### 1. Project Initialization
- Created a new repository: [VibeParse](https://github.com/gkrinker/VibeParse)
- Added key planning documents:
  - [Product Requirements Document (prd.md)](prd.md)
  - [Development Plan (development-plan.md)](development-plan.md)
  - Updated [README](readme.md) to link to these documents

### 2. Backend Setup (Phase 1)
- Set up a Python FastAPI backend with the following structure:
  - `src/api/app.py`: Main FastAPI app
  - `src/api/routes/code.py`: API endpoint for code fetching
  - `src/services/github_service.py`: Service for interacting with the GitHub API
  - `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
  - `.gitignore`: Now excludes `.env` and other sensitive files
- Added a `.env` file (not tracked in git) for storing the GitHub Personal Access Token

### 3. GitHub Code Fetching
- Implemented `/api/fetch-code` endpoint:
  - Supports both single file (`/blob/branch/path`) and directory (`/tree/branch/path`) GitHub URLs
  - Handles branch names correctly when fetching content
  - Allows filtering by file type for directories
  - Added an optional `save_to_disk` flag to save fetched files locally in a `test_output/` directory, preserving structure
- Example usage:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/fetch-code \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "github_url": "https://github.com/gkrinker/snap-read/tree/main/src",
      "file_types": ["ts", "tsx", "js"],
      "save_to_disk": true
    }'
  ```

### 4. Security & Git Hygiene
- Accidentally committed `.env` (with secret) to git; push was blocked by GitHub
- Removed `.env` from git tracking and history using `git filter-repo --force`
- Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub
- Confirmed repository is now safe and up to date

### 5. Next Steps
- Phase 1 (code retrieval) is complete and tested
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Code Analysis & Script Generation
