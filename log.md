# üìù VibeParse Project Log

## Summary of Progress (as of June 2024)

### 1. Project Initialization
- Created a new repository: [VibeParse](https://github.com/gkrinker/VibeParse)
- Added key planning documents:
  - [Product Requirements Document (prd.md)](prd.md)
  - [Development Plan (development-plan.md)](development-plan.md)
  - Updated [README](readme.md) to link to these documents

### 2. Backend Setup (Phase 1)
- Set up a Python FastAPI backend with the following structure:
  - `src/api/app.py`: Main FastAPI app
  - `src/api/routes/code.py`: API endpoint for code fetching
  - `src/services/github_service.py`: Service for interacting with the GitHub API
  - `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
  - `.gitignore`: Now excludes `.env` and other sensitive files
- Added a `.env` file (not tracked in git) for storing the GitHub Personal Access Token

### 3. GitHub Code Fetching
- Implemented `/api/fetch-code` endpoint:
  - Supports both single file (`/blob/branch/path`) and directory (`/tree/branch/path`) GitHub URLs
  - Handles branch names correctly when fetching content
  - Allows filtering by file type for directories
  - Added an optional `save_to_disk` flag to save fetched files locally in a `test_output/` directory, preserving structure
- Example usage:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/fetch-code \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "github_url": "https://github.com/gkrinker/snap-read/tree/main/src",
      "file_types": ["ts", "tsx", "js"],
      "save_to_disk": true
    }'
  ```

### 4. Security & Git Hygiene
- Accidentally committed `.env` (with secret) to git; push was blocked by GitHub
- Removed `.env` from git tracking and history using `git filter-repo --force`
- Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub
- Confirmed repository is now safe and up to date

### 5. Next Steps
- Phase 1 (code retrieval) is complete and tested
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Code Analysis & Script Generation
