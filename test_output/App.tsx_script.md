# Code Explanation Script

## Scene 1: Setting the Stage with Imports (20s)

In this scene, we're focusing on the opening lines of our code, where we bring in various components and libraries necessary for our application to function properly. Think of this as gathering all the tools you need before starting a project.


### Code Highlights

**src/App.tsx** (lines 2-10):
```
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";
import { Toaster as Sonner } from "@/components/ui/sonner";
import { TooltipProvider } from "@/components/ui/tooltip";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
```
These lines import essential UI components for notifications (Toaster and Sonner) and tooltips (TooltipProvider). We're also bringing in React Query components for managing data and React Router components for navigation. Each import represents a specific functionality or feature we will use later in our application.

## Scene 2: Creating the Query Client (15s)

Now that we have our libraries imported, let's create a new instance of the Query Client. This will help us manage data fetching and server state throughout our app.

```tsx
const queryClient = new QueryClient();
```
Here, the `queryClient` is initialized. Think of this as setting up a central hub that will handle all the communication with our server, ensuring data is fetched and stored efficiently.



---

## Scene 3: Wrapping the App with Providers (25s)

We're building the foundation of our app by wrapping it with several providers. These providers are like layers that add various capabilities to our app, such as data management and UI features.


### Code Highlights

**src/App.tsx** (lines 19-21):
```
<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
  <TooltipProvider>
```
The `QueryClientProvider` and `TooltipProvider` wrap our application, which means all components inside have access to the features they provide. `QueryClientProvider` is for data fetching, while `TooltipProvider` ensures tooltips work throughout the app.



---

## Scene 4: Adding Notification Systems (20s)

Notifications are crucial for user feedback. In this scene, we'll see how we integrate two different notification systems into our app.


### Code Highlights

**src/App.tsx** (lines 23-25):
```
<Toaster />
<Sonner />
```
These components are for toast notifications. Imagine them as digital post-it notes that pop up to inform users about actions or updates. While both do similar things, having two systems allows flexibility in how notifications are displayed.



---

## Scene 5: Setting Up Routing (30s)

Finally, let's look at how we set up routes in our application. This is how we define different paths users can take within our appâ€”like setting up a map with various destinations.


### Code Highlights

**src/App.tsx** (lines 27-33):
```
<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
    <Route path="/flashcards" element={<FlashcardViewer />} />
    <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```
The `BrowserRouter` and `Routes` components create a navigation system. Each `Route` is a path users can visit, directing them to different components: the homepage (`Index`), a flashcard viewer, or a `NotFound` page for any undefined paths, much like directing traffic to the correct roads.


With these scenes, you should have a foundational understanding of how this component integrates various functionalities to build a robust web application. Each part plays a vital role in creating a seamless user experience.
