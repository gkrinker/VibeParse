# Code Explanation Script

## Scene 1: Setting the Stage with Imports (30s)

In this scene, we'll introduce the various libraries and components that are imported to build our application. These are like the tools and materials needed to construct our app's user interface and functionality.


### Code Highlights

**App.tsx** (lines 2-13):
```
// Import UI components for notifications and tooltips
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";
import { Toaster as Sonner } from "@/components/ui/sonner";
import { TooltipProvider } from "@/components/ui/tooltip";

// Import React Query for data fetching and state management
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// Import React Router components for navigation
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
```
Here, we import various components and libraries. The `Toaster` and `Sonner` are for displaying notifications, while `TooltipProvider` is for tooltips. `QueryClient` and `QueryClientProvider` from React Query are used for data management, and React Router components are imported for handling navigation in our app.

## Scene 2: Bringing in the Pages (20s)

Let's look at how our app's different pages are connected. This setup is like setting up different rooms in a house.


### Code Highlights

**App.tsx** (lines 15-17):
```
// Import page components
import Index from "./pages/Index";
import FlashcardViewer from "./pages/FlashcardViewer";
import NotFound from "./pages/NotFound";
```
These imports bring in the components for the different pages of our application: the home page (`Index`), a flashcard viewer, and a `NotFound` page for unrecognized routes.



---

## Scene 3: Initializing the Query Client (15s)

Now, let's set up the brain of our data management system with React Query. This is like setting up a central hub for all data-related activities.


### Code Highlights

**App.tsx** (lines 19-20):
```
// Initialize React Query client for managing server state
const queryClient = new QueryClient();
```
We create a new instance of `QueryClient`. This client will manage the server state across our application, allowing us to fetch and cache data efficiently.



---

## Scene 4: Building the Application's Structure (45s)

In this critical scene, we'll assemble the main structure of our application using providers and routing. Think of this as constructing the framework of our house, where each section has a specific purpose.


### Code Highlights

**App.tsx** (lines 23-43):
```
const App = () => (
  // Wrap the app with React Query provider for data fetching
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    {/* Provide tooltip context for all tooltips in the app */}
    <TooltipProvider>
      {/* Toast notifications for user feedback */}
      <Toaster />
      {/* Alternative toast notification system */}
      <Sonner />
      {/* Set up routing for the application */}
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>
          {/* Home page route */}
          <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
          {/* Flashcard viewer route */}
          <Route path="/flashcards" element={<FlashcardViewer />} />
          {/* Catch-all route for 404 pages */}
          <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
        </Routes>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </TooltipProvider>
  </QueryClientProvider>
);
```
This is the main component of our app. We use `QueryClientProvider` to make our query client available throughout the app. `TooltipProvider` wraps our app to enable tooltips. We include `Toaster` and `Sonner` for displaying notifications. Finally, we set up routing with `BrowserRouter` and `Routes`, defining paths to different pages.



---

## Scene 5: Wrapping Up with Export (10s)

Finally, we conclude by making our `App` component available for use in other parts of the application. This is like opening the doors of our newly built house.

```tsx
export default App;
```
This line exports the `App` component, allowing it to be imported and used in other files, such as the main entry file where the app is rendered to the DOM.
